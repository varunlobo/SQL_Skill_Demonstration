# SQL_Skill_Demonstration
Practise SQL queries and syntax for skill development


In this notebook, I've created a database using SQLite3, and demonstrated my knowledge in SQL queries. 

I've demonstrated knowledge in the following:
<li> Comparison and logical functions like =, <, >, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, NOT IN
<li> Sorting function eg: ORDER BY ASC or DSC
<li> Aggregate functions like: Count, MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
<li> Using CASE functions for conditional analysis (WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END)
<li> Using Joins (Inner, FULL Outer, LEFT, RIGHT)
<li> Using Date formating tools like DATEPART()
<li> String manipulation functions (LEFT, RIGHT, LOWER, UPPER, POSITION, STRPOS, CONCAT)
<li> Changing datatypes using CAST
<li> Data Wrangling using (TRIM, LENGTH, SUBSTR)
<li> Subqueries using WITH clause
